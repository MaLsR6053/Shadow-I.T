<h2>What is Shadow I.T.?</h2>

- <b><i>Shadow I.T. is when an enterprise employee or section uses an unauthorized physical device, application or cloud service on the enterprise network. </i></b>
- There should be a process for the approval and installation of any device or service that accesses the network, however, I’ve learned that sometimes sections or employees purchase solutions outside of the approved method.

<h2>What does this mean for the network and data?</h2>

- The unauthorized device or service might not be patched and updated regularly or properly, allowing threat actors potentially vast avenues to exploit.
- The security team cannot secure systems that they might not even be aware of.
- Data being used and saved may not be part of the approved enterprise backup process, potentially allowing data to be lost or not in compliance with regulations. 

<h2>What controls can you put in place to help prevent this?</h2>

- Have a complete and accurate asset inventory.
- Make sure that there IS a change and acquisition process in place, and that your teams understand and follow the process.
- Strong policies in place that make sure security is a priority. Ensure that a culture of security exists with your team. Nobody should be afraid to speak up about a situation for fear of retribution. 
- Monitoring the network via a SIEM, a tool like Wireshark, Nmap scans or cloud provider solution like CASB (Cloud Access Security Broker).
- And finally, Network Access Control using approved certificates so that an unauthorized device is unable to connect.
